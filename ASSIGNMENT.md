# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> The first part difficult part was to understand how everything overall was working. The big picture as some would say. This took the most time and 
it was extremely helpful reading the example code that came with the module. This module did a strang thing that makes sense in javascript
but makes it extremely confusing is that it defines a series of functions attached to variables inside the main end-all-be-all method
and uses them whenever the modules sees fit. This was difficult to understand at first and clouded the true scope of what the function did
because only about 10 or so lines written natively for the actual method was run.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Write comments like a blackbox first. Write it like the only thing I know is the name of the function. What do I need to know about the function,
what it does, it's parameters and what it throws back at me. If there are any pitfalls then those would be useful to know too.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> About 5


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Exclusively helped others actually. All the help I got was from the internet.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Double check all the presented modules worked. I had to alter the source code for the module that I picked because it wasn't updated in a while and
some of the code it was using would not be parsed by jsdocs. This caused a problem which I had to look into and then arbitrarily fix in order for
jsdocs to properly work. This is where I actually helped other people with.
